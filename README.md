Repository for the manuscript *Leveraging Pre-Vaccination Antibody Titers across Multiple Influenza H3N2 Variants to Forecast the Post-Vaccination Response*. We present an algorithm that uses an individual's pre-vaccination antibody titers against different influenza variants to predict their post-vaccination response.
